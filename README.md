snes cic implementation with FPGA FireAnt board

Personally I got this board from Mouser, but the board comes without the packaging that contains the serial number that is normally required to register the device with Efinix (https://www.efinixinc.com/products-efinity.html). I contacted them to create an account in order to download the IDE and have access to support.
